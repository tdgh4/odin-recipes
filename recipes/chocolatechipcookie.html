            You have to test out this delicious chocolate chip recipe. Once you try this sweet, soft, and crispy cookie, you'll never go back to eating prepackaged cookies.
            For our family, these don't last long, the hardest part is waiting for them to cool down after taking them out of the oven!
            So good that you'll have to make two batches. Or three. We promise we won't tattle if you broke your New Years Resolution!
