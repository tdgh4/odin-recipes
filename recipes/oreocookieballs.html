        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>These are the easy way, no bake, cheaters guide to making quick and easy cakeballs! Without the cake recipe. Or, if you're like me,
            without the shelfstable cakemix.
        </p>

        <p>The best way to make these are to eat while you're making it, so at the end there's not much left over for any events. So might as well double
            up the recipe and lick those crumbs off your fingers every couple of steps. Unless you're making it for an event, then wash your fingers between taste testing.
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A Package of Oreos (anything you don't use can go in your tummy while you wait for the chocolate to set)</li>
            <li>1 package of cream cheese, softened</li>
            <li>1 package of chocolate chips (melted)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Crush the Oreo cookies into crumbs</li>
            <li>Add cream cheese and crushed oreos together and mix</li>
            <li>Using either a small cookie scoop (or your hands), form mixture into small balls and transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet</li>
            <li>Pop into the freezer until firm</li>
            <li>Dip frozen Oreo balls into melted chocolate until coated and place them back on the baking sheet</li>
            <li>Let the chocolate harden by leaving them out or placing it in the freezer for about 10 minutes</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
